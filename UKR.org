* Known Issues / Bugs

** DONE Launch Screen render error
   CLOSED: [2020-11-25 ke 14:56]
   Flashes for a little while when opening the application for the first time. Should be easily fixed by implementing null player item check.

   
** DONE Playback controls overflow error
   CLOSED: [2020-11-25 ke 15:26]
   Control buttons overflow on very narrow screen. As this is written, implemented by the following line:

    #+BEGIN_SRC dart
      final _contSize = min(40.0, MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 6 - 28.0);
    #+END_SRC

** TODO Player switcher doesn't actually change the player value of the multiprovider providers
   Strange...

*** DONE Check with other stream.
    CLOSED: [2020-11-27 pe 21:42]
    Current fix has the stream pause before redefining the subscription
    #+BEGIN_SRC dart
      this._subscription.pause();
      this._subscription = ...;
      this._subscription.resume();
    #+END_SRC

    Needs to be checked with localhost player. Might cause memory leaks, or might not work as expected when there are two valid streams instead of just one.

*** TODO Check for memory leaks (With devtools on Android emulator)

** TODO Fix local player(s) not going through with the API network check
