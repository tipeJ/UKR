* Known Issues / Bugs

** DONE Launch Screen render error
   CLOSED: [2020-11-25 ke 14:56]
   Flashes for a little while when opening the application for the first time. Should be easily fixed by implementing null player item check.

   
** TODO Playback controls overflow error
   Control buttons overflow on very narrow screen. As this is written, implemented by the following line:

    #+BEGIN_SRC dart
      final _contSize = min(40.0, MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 6 - 28.0);
    #+END_SRC
