   CLOSED: [2020-11-29 su 21:19]
   Old providers are deprecated. Not yet cleaned up.
** TODO Clean old implementation
*** TODO Clean api_provider
    Currently has a lot of deprecated endpoints that are now used in the UKProvider class
*** TODO Clean up providers
    The following providers are no longer used:
    1. Main_Provider
    2. Application_Provider
    3. Item_Provider
       
** TODO [#B] Poster background completion
   Currently the poster background contains only the label for the currently playing item.

*** [#A] Movies
    * Title
    * Year
    * Director
    * Rating
    * Duration?

*** [#B] TV
    Same as movies, but producers instead of directors. Additionally:
    * Season
    * Episode

*** [#C] Audio
    * Year
    * Rating
    * Disc
    * Track number
    * Artist
    * Album

** DONE Playback controls
   CLOSED: [2020-11-29 su 20:26]
   Still not implemented:
   * Short Rewind/Skip
   * Prev/Next
** DONE [#A] Seekbar
   CLOSED: [2020-11-29 su 21:23]
   Implement the seekbar properly. Currently has a placeholder but does not work.

*** DONE [#A] Implement LIVE tag
    CLOSED: [2020-11-25 ke 15:20]
    For when the stream is not seekable.

*** TODO [#B] Seek

** TODO [#B] Playlist Support

** TODO Advanced player management

*** TODO Automatic latest player selection on startup
    Currently takes the first player in the storage box.

*** TODO Player deletion

*** TODO Player editing

*** TODO Player Password/Username implementation
    Current implementation does not support auth.

** TODO Image fetching for movies (TMDB, etc.)
   Works, but not on initial launch. The selector doesn't seem to find any difference between the artwork maps.
** TODO Content browsing
   
*** TODO [#C] Add-Ons
    Browse All add-ons quickly and efficiently.
    Should be quickly accessible from the remote screen.
    
*** TODO Files
    Not nearly as important, as I don't really use this feature all that much yet.
    
** TODO Notifications

*** TODO Android

*** TODO iOS / iPadOS

*** Desktop??
    No API exists yet for environments like KDE or Windows. Perhaps I should create that myself if it seems to take too long..?
* Known Issues / Bugs

** DONE Launch Screen render error
   CLOSED: [2020-11-25 ke 14:56]
   Flashes for a little while when opening the application for the first time. Should be easily fixed by implementing null player item check.

   
** DONE Playback controls overflow error
   CLOSED: [2020-11-25 ke 15:26]
   Control buttons overflow on very narrow screen. As this is written, implemented by the following line:

    #+BEGIN_SRC dart
      final _contSize = min(40.0, MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 6 - 28.0);
    #+END_SRC

** TODO Player switcher doesn't actually change the player value of the multiprovider providers
   Strange...

*** DONE Check with other stream.
    CLOSED: [2020-11-27 pe 21:42]
    Current fix has the stream pause before redefining the subscription
    #+BEGIN_SRC dart
      this._subscription.pause();
      this._subscription = ...;
      this._subscription.resume();
    #+END_SRC

    Needs to be checked with localhost player. Might cause memory leaks, or might not work as expected when there are two valid streams instead of just one.

*** TODO Check for memory leaks (With devtools on Android emulator)

** TODO Fix local player(s) not going through with the API network check

** TODO Android UKProvider doesn't receive any data
   Works in emulator, not with real device (H910). The provider reads audio change events, but doesn't do anything with the data.
   The receiver sometimes reports an object sent by XBMC, describing a parse error. Works neither in release nor debug mode. Profile not tested.
   Cause unknown, no issues reported on a debug instance running on an emulator (API 30)

*** Tests
    Not caused by encoding command being run in an isolate function. The behaviour persists on non-isolate version.

** TODO Artwork not showing before widget rebuilds
** TODO Fix ( initial ) playback data sometimes not being applied on launch
   Usually works on repeated launches.
