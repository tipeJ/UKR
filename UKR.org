    3. Item_Provider
       
** Wide-Screen support

   "Content" being either playlist or content browser.

    Sync accuracy should be monitored. Current solution does not verify the change via the API, as the plugin reorderable_list required syncronous solution.

    No API exists yet for environments like KDE or Windows. Perhaps I should create that myself if it seems to take too long..?
* Known Issues / Bugs

*** TODO Check for memory leaks (With devtools on Android emulator)

*** Tests
    Not caused by encoding command being run in an isolate function. The behaviour persists on non-isolate version.

** TODO Cannot load issues from Kodi instances protected by password.
** TODO Addons hero animation causes hero tag exception

** TODO Time and totaltime sometimes not syncing when navigating in the playlist
   
** TODO Android devices require platform channel Mdns implementation.
   A pure dart solution would be ideal, as provided by the multicast_dns plugin.
