* Building
  Many of the packages that this application use older versions of dart, and you need to have the following flag at the beginning of main.dart (Includede by default) before any imports:
  #+BEGIN_SRC dart
    // @dart=2.9
    import ..
    import ..
  #+END_SRC

  Run flutter build in the root directory.
