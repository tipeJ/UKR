* About

Universal Kodi Remote. This is a cross-platform Kodi remote designed to work not only on mobile platforms (iOS, Android, Fuschia), but also on Desktop environments, and maybe even as a Web application. Created as a reactive programming learning exercise.

This application makes use of the [[https://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API/v12][Kodi JSONRPC Api.
]]
** Languages

Currently only supports english.

* Installation

  Will be added soon to the Google Play Store. Builds for android are available on the releases page.

** Linux
  Currently being built and tested on Linux. Builds are not available yet. Will be added in the future. Feel free to build it yourself using the instructions below.

** MacOS / iOS
   Probable not available any time soon. I'm not about to pay Apple 120â‚¬ to ship free open source software on their platforms. Features should be stable for both platforms. Feel free to release a build if you use MacOS.

* Building
  Many of the packages that this application use older versions of dart, and you need to have the following flag at the beginning of main.dart (Included by default) before any imports in order to build without [[https://dart.dev/null-safety][Sound Null Safety]]:
  #+BEGIN_SRC dart
    // @dart=2.9
    import ..
    import ..
  #+END_SRC

  Run flutter build in the root directory.
